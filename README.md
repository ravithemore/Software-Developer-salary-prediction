## It's an Application which predicts the salary of a software engineers based on the data from stackoverflow . It is trained to predict it from the data using Machine Learning. It's App is designed using python with simple and basic gui.

### Libraries used:
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)


###  App
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) A faster way to build and share data apps.Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps,No front end or anything else is required just pure Python.

## Setup:
run:
```
$ py -3 -m venv venv
```
The [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) module supports creating lightweight ‚Äúvirtual environments‚Äù, each with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site directories.

Then Activate the Machine Learning Environment by:
```
$ conda create -n ml python=3.9
```
Then activate it by:
```
$ conda activate
```
Now, install Streamlitb by:
```
$ conda install streamlit
```

You can use both Setup: ```pip``` or ```conda```

Now, install all the required Libraries by running following commands:
```
$ pip install  numpy pandas
```

```
$ pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Then, a virtual environment to play with the data....
```
$ ipython kernel install --user --name=ml
```

If you like the project . Give it a star.
